{"name":"Chronicle","body":"# Chronicle\r\n\r\nBy Jack McDade\r\n\r\nChronicle is a simple, chronilogically organized, file-based publishing engine. It takes a content directory (which can contain literally anything you want, as long as you have an index.php file), adds a little yaml magic for meta data, and powers all the navigation between entries. Inspired in part by my buddy [Travis Schmeisser](http://twitter.com/rockthenroll).\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n* Drop Chronicle on your server (local or otherwise)\r\n* Customize the main `config.yaml` file to set your global site information\r\n* rename the `htaccess` file to `.htaccess` (support for no mod_rewrite access is on the roadmap)\r\n* Start publishing!\r\n\r\n## Diving In\r\n\r\n* Chronicle looks for date-based directories inside the `/content` directory and will automatically redirect the user to the newest \"entry\" upon visiting the root url (\"/\").\r\n* Your entries have `$prev` and `$next` path variables available to use in your index.php file. For example, add previous and next entry navigation. Look in the `/content` directory for examples\r\n* If you add a `meta.yaml` file to any given content subdirectory, any of the [YAML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) key:value pairs will be availble to use in both the index.php view and archive listing page.\r\n* Your archive page will pull all the meta data from all of your content directories to help you build a list. Look at `content/archive/index.php` for some examples.\r\n\r\n## Helpers\r\n\r\n* `asset_path()`: pass in the relative path to any asset (e.g. CSS, JS, image) and it returns the correct full server path. See `content/20120330/index.php` for an example.\r\n\r\n### More complete documentation coming soon!","tagline":"Chronicle is a light-weight and flexible, file-based publishing engine.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
